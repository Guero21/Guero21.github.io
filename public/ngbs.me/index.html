			<p>
				This notice serves to formally assert my rights and express unequivocal objection to any actions or representations that degrade, ridicule, or misrepresent my person or experiences. I, Nicholas Guthrie, categorically deny consent to any form of public exposure intended to distort factual occurrences, undermine my credibility, or compromise my mental well-being. Such activities are conducted against my will and are hereby denounced.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is imperative that all parties involved be duly informed of this stance. Any individual engaging in or facilitating such deplorable acts should be held accountable and deemed complicit in their perpetration. Furthermore, they are hereby put on notice that they may be subject to civil liability for any resulting damages.
			</p>
			<p>
				In light of the severity of these transgressions, it is imperative that legal authorities intervene. I implore the State's Attorneys of Nevada, California, and Florida to conduct thorough investigations into these allegations. Criminal charges should be pursued against perpetrators, ranging from kidnapping and psychological abuse to harassment, depending on the extent of their involvement.
			<p>
				The assessment of culpability should extend to the mental state of the perpetrators. Those found guilty must not only face appropriate punitive measures but also undergo comprehensive evaluation and, if necessary, rehabilitation tailored to address the underlying motivations driving their criminal behavior.
			</p>
			<p>
				Moreover, any medical professionals found to have either condoned or failed to report such criminal activities must be held to account. Their licenses should be revoked, and they should face criminal charges for their complicity in these heinous acts. The State's Attorneys of Florida, California, and Nevada are urged to prosecute these individuals to the fullest extent of the law, in accordance with each state's respective statutes and ethical standards governing medical practice.
